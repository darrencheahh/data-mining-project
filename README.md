The code is predominantly build to mimic real-time news analysis. The concept in which I did this is through using Python Package spaCy to help apply natural language processing
to the large dataset that I got from Kaggle. 

Then after processing the dataset, I would feed each of the processed headlines to ChatGPT to see if they would give a neutral, positive or negative sentiment analysis for the headline. 

ChatGPT would also help me summarise the overall sentiment of the year according to the key topics the chatbot got from the pilot study, and highlight the predicted trends for the year.
